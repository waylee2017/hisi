make:
	The same as make help.

make help:

make prepare:

make build:
	Make prepare, all and install.
	
make distclean:
	Clean all.

make rebuild:
	Clean all, then build again.
	
make all:
	Will make hiboot, linux, rootfs, common, msp and component.

make clean:
	Will clean hiboot, linux, rootfs, common, msp and component.
	
make install:
	Will install hiboot, linux, rootfs, common, msp, component, rootbox,
	then create filesystem image, make sample lastly.

make uninstall:
	Will uninstall hiboot, linux, rootfs, common, msp and component.

make XXX:
	The XXX can be hiboot, linux, rootfs, common, msp, component or sample, 
	make them respectively.

make XXX_clean:
	The XXX can be hiboot, linux, rootfs, common, msp, component or sample, 
	clean them respectively.
	
make XXX_install:
	The XXX can be hiboot, linux, rootfs, common, msp or component, 
	install them respectively.

make XXX_uninstall:
	The XXX can be hiboot, linux, rootfs, common, msp or component,
	uninstall them respectively.

make rootbox_install:
	Install rootbox.
	
make fs:
	Create filesystem images.

Sub modules of msp, component and sample can be make respectively, their commond:
	make XXX M=MODULE_NAME
	make XXX_clean M=MODULE_NAME
	make XXX_install M=MODULE_NAME
	make XXX_uninstall M=MODULE_NAME
Examples:
	make msp M=i2c
	make sample M=esplay
	
You can compile in every directory which includes a Makefile, for example, you can use
	make sample M=esplay
in ${SDK_DIR}, or use
	make esplay
in ${SDK_DIR}/sample, or use
	make
